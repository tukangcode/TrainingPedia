# TrainingPedia

**TrainingPedia** (formerly known as *clonepeda*) is a static HTML and JavaScript site designed to replicate and create an open-source version of a course site. The purpose of TrainingPedia is to provide a simple, open-source design that anyone can use to create their own course website or, simply, to explore and have some fun.

The original site this project is replicating is **[https://skillpedia.id/](https://skillpedia.id/)**.

## Features

### Prerequisites

You'll need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to modify the template. You will also need:
